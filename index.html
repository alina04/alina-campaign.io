          <p>
            Hey guys! If you're seeing this that means you either scanned my QR
            code or got the link somehow! Thanks for taking the time to look at
            the website I made and considering me for secretary for the National
            Honor Society. First of all, I was the secretary of my middle school
            National Junior Honor Society chapter which proves that I am fit for
            the role. I am extremly commited and hardworking and I manage my
            time well. Education has always been my biggest priority and I have
            been an honors student since the 3rd grade, and my GPA is currently
            4.78. Being the secretary of the National Honor Society would allow
            me to obtain a different perspective and further educate myself. I
            promise to meet the needs of my peers and collaborate with other in
            order to keep the chapter running smoothly all year (2021-2022).
